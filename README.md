# Fixing Errors

In this repository is 17 javascript files that will test your javascript debugging skills.

## Lesson Setup Forking and Cloning
First you will need to fork the repo. This will create a copy of the repository on you github account this allows the repository's 
owner to keep a clean working code base while you can make changes to the code on your own repo.
To fork the repository look for the fork button at the top right, under your profile image.
Once you fork the repository to your account you will then need to clone the project into cloud9. 
Cloning a repository is similiar to forking you will have a remote repository, or online repository on github
and a working repository on your cloud9. In order to clone your fix-errors repo click the clone or download button.
Then copy the url. Now back in cloud9 in your bash terminal from you challenges directory
```
    git clone <repo url>
```    
Make sure to replace `< repo url>` with the url you copied from the repository on github. 
Angle braces , `<>` commonly surround where the command needs information that is specific to you.
