## Getting Started on the Lesson
First you will need to fork the repo. This will create a copy of the repository on you github account this allows the repository's owner to keep a clean working code base while you can make changes on your own repo..
To fork the repository look for the fork button at the top right, under your profile image.
Once you fork the repository to your account you will then need to clone the project into cloud9. Cloning a repository is similiar to forking you will have a remote repository, or online repository and a working repository on your cloud9
